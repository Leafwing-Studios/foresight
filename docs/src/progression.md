# Summary

Level up at the end of every fight, other than the tutorial fights

Each time you level up: 
- Choose a new ability/spell from a random pool of 3
- Pick two. You cannot pick the same one more than once
  - Increase a special defense by 4 (this is actually three options)
  - Incrase your dodge bonus by 2
